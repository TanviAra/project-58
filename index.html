        <p>Painting is one of those hobbies that gives me an opportunity to relax, enjoy and learn at the same time. I cannot imagine my life without colours and the essence of a painting lies in its colour schema itself.
            painting is my favorite hobby
            I like to make paintings of different things
            When I do painting, I lost in doing it
            In the beginning, I wasn't able to do painting properly
            But now, my painting is very good
            My mother and father love my paintings
            My mother also helps with my painting
            I have received the first prize in my school's painting competition.</p>
